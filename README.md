# Face-Recognizer

## Details

This project is built using NodeJs along with ProstgreSql for the database. This is the back end of the app, you can find the code for the front end of the website here: https://github.com/WattBowers/facerecognizer-front. This project was built with the help from the great mentors at Zero to Mastery on Udemy.

### What I learned

Implementing the back end of this website took quite a bit of trial and error. I had a lot to learn about the intricacies of how the web works, how Node.js interacts with the React front end, how different types of requests to servers should be handled, and the suite of testing tools that are available to handle different server requests, (Postman for example). Back end is not my specialty, however learning it on a more fundamental level has given me more insight on the proper way to interact with the back end of different projects. And has made me a more well rounded front end developer. 

In doing the back end of this project, something else I discovered is how transferable different skills in software are. The most important tool in the coding tool belt isnâ€™t the language per say, but the overarching structures and methods that are used throughout different languages and frameworks. Every project I have completed since this one, I have been much less intimidated by experimenting with new frameworks, and the amount of time it takes to pick up new skills has decreased dramatically. 

### Getting this to run

This code is hosted on Heroku. Feel free to clone the code to see what is going on under the hood.
